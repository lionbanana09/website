            <h4>
                My personality
            </h4>
            <p>
                I am a agreeable person and like to get along with people around me but i still make sure my opinion is heard when its needed. When working on a project the first
                thing i do is break down the problem into sections on trello. I then make work through them error checking after i completed each section. Finaly i get 
                others to use the program and provide feedback. As i person i cant be content with being complacent and constatly stirve to improve and learn new skills.
                I like to work in a team and while i prefer not to i can lead a group when needed. I was once a sea cadet so i have alot of experience working as a team who are often 
                people i have only just met that day. I also learnt some useful skills in the sea cadets such as First aid, Seamanship and learnt how to conduct myself when representing 
                an oraganisation.
