                <p>Isopod Adventure is a simple python game made for a year 9 computer science assignment. We were tasked to make a game that had a simple choice a or b selection. 
                    However, i wanted to challenge myself and tried to make a simple turn based combat text based dungeon crawler that randomly selects from a list or "rooms" each floor.
                    looking back it was extremely simple code but it was the first time i challeged myself to do 
                    more than the assignment asked for and it later served as inspiration for one of my bigger projects. While i have lost the original code i still have one of the later
                    protoypes.

                <p>In year nine the the academy behind my school ran a cometition to make an app idea to present to IBM. The first round was a submision of the app concept, the second an
                    ad for the app and the final round was a presentation infront of the IBM judges. My team of 3 made it to the finals despite 100s of teams competeing and while we 
                    didnt win it was a valuable learning experience.

                <p>WhiLE i still programed for my course. my next project wasnt until my 1st year of college in computer science.
                    We were tasked to make an aplicattion that displayed all of the skills we had learnt in class along with documentation for its aplications and creation.
                    Once again i decided to push myself and decided to incoperate a client-server network into my project something i knew little about. 
                    Online blackjack is a blackjack simulator with online capabilities. This was the first time i had to use code that wasnt taught in a lesson.
                    While there is a download of this project it wont run unless you port foward all of the ports at the top of each section of code.

                <p> Into the castle is a unity game made for my games development course. we had to make a 3D platformer and i chose to make a rouglike dungeon crawler.
                    it has a level system, randomly generated dungeon, turn based combat and a hub world. If you wish to play and downlaod the file and either run the exe or 
                    the open it in python. if you die and with to try again enter the hole between the path and the sea. Most of the assets in the game wernt made by me and were
                    obtained from sketchfab. Some of the textures such as for the cliffs or sand are made by me using real pictures and photoshop to make it smoothly transiton
                     and to make normal maps

                <p> This project is an online FPS game using Unity. After finishing college i saw both the into the castle game and online blackjack and wanted to try
                    and combine them. I decided to make an Multiplayer FPS where everything like movement was handled server side like alot of active online games.
                    I still only had a little knowledge of Networking but i still pushed myself and i am pround of the end product. Much like the other unity game you can
                    run it from the executable or with unity. You may need to change the ip before running it.

                <p> This project was an attempt at creating a Ai chatbot. I created this around the ChatGPT hype as i wanted to get an understanting of how chatbots work and gain 
                    usefull skills. I tried two different aproaches to the chatbot following an online tutorial:
                    <br> The first was made from scratch using transformers and the diabloGPT data. This chatbot worked 
                    but the replies were often unrelated to the question. <br> The next was made using the chatterbot library. This chatbot stayed on topic more often and can 
                    easily be trained by adding more training converstaions.

                    can interact with hardware. The modules include: an LCD, and RFID sensor inertia sensor,a servo motor,
                    a stepper motor, an led dot matrix, a 1 digit 7 segment display, a 4 digit 7 segemt display, an active

                <p> Of course another project is this very Website itself. I decided i wanted to program this website myself using HTML,CSS and javascript rather that uning a 
                    creator such as wixx or squarespace. I had a limited knowledge of html and css or web design
                    when starting this website but still wanted to create it from scratch, so throught the process of creating this website i have learnt html, css and javascript.
